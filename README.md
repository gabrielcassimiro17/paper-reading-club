# Paper-Reading Club

How It Works:

Each week, the group selects the next paper that we will collectively study. Throughout the week, each member reads the paper individually and then meets with the rest of the club once a week.

The meeting is structured in three parts:

1. A randomly selected member explains the paper in their own words. (20 minutes)
2. A general discussion about the paper is conducted, covering topics such as difficult concepts, clever breakthroughs, interesting sections, and potential day-to-day applications. (40 minutes)
3. After a coffee break, there is an optional time to talk about any subject indefinitely.
